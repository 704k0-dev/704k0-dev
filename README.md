  Hi! This is Joaco. Welcome!

<p>I have extensive experience in digital marketing optimizing campaigns and creating strategies for international businesses.</p> 
<p>Now, I am expanding my skills into data analysis through a comprehensive boot camp at Tripleten, complemented by hands-on experience with data from my own web projects. This journey has allowed me to develop proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Additionally, I have built a solid foundation in web development (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript) and analytical tools such as Google Analytics and Excel, which enhance my data-driven approach.</p>

<p>My goal is to leverage this diverse skill set across various applications, websites, and projects, ensuring accuracy and reliability in data analysis. By combining my analytical capabilities with practical research skills and extensive local knowledge from years of living in different cities, I am well-prepared to tackle real-world data challenges. I look forward to making meaningful contributions through innovative data analysis and technical solutions.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Joaco</p>
